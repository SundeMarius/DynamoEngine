## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is an attempt to create a "game engine" that serves as a starting point to create a multitude of different 2D games.

The game engine is written in C++, and it provides a window system and an event system powered by SDL2.

**NB:** Only Linux is currently supported.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

This game engine depends only on SDL2 which is typically provided by the package manager on your linux distribution.

On Debian based distributions (like Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc.), do
```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
